Overview
========

This documentation plan outlines the strategy for updating all existing
documentation to make it ready for the ***MyCompany Jupiter*** Ganymede
release (3.2). It is addressed to Product Marketing, Professional
Services, Product Development, and Customer Support staff within
MyCompany to inform them about the documentation efforts that will be
undertaken for this release. Its purpose is also to secure their
support, in the form of a commitment to:

1. Provide the information, equipment, and personnel resources necessary
   (such as developers’ time for interviews, reviews, walkthroughs,
   problem-solving) during research, documentation development and
   testing; and

2. Review and approve drafts and final documentation.

Scope
-----

This documentation plan includes the development of updates to all user
and developer, VAR, alliance or partner documentation required for the
release of the MyCompany Jupiter version 3.2. Specifically, it covers
updating:

-  User Guide ("Operations" guide)

-  Jupiter Installation Guide

-  HTML Help File

-  Readme File

Scope of the information development activity in providing updates to
the above documents includes research, writing, reviews, revisions, and
production of the final PDFs or HTML of each publication. This activity
also necessarily involves user testing of the

Since updating the documentation primarily involves merging interim
information that was released with versions 3.0.11 through 3.1 in the
form of application notes, release notes, etc., no "new" information
will be included **except** as it relates to the approved enhancements
and bug fixes for the version 3.2 release. That is, we anticipate no new
or previously undocumented components in Io.

Assumptions and Constraints
---------------------------

It is assumed that the readers of this document are familiar with the
MyCompany Windows for Documents product strategy. It is also assumed
that the required resources will be available to achieve the objectives
of the plan, and that there are no risks other than those identified in
the section on Risks.

Constraints on this documentation project are the available time of the
Technical Writer, the published scope, and the product delivery
schedule. Any changes in workload, or delays in gaining access to the
product, will affect the documentation plan.

Design Implications
===================

The MyCompany Jupiter documents have a consistent look and feel, and
were imported into a newly-designed template for version 3.0 release.
This template will be maintained for all publications.

Documentation Specifications
============================

The following specifications address the content and publication
requirements.

Platforms Supported
-------------------

All documentation, except for Help files in HTML format, is accessible
on all platforms via PDF, through Adobe Acrobat Reader 3.0 and above.
HTML format documentation is accessible on all browser-compliant
platforms.

Graphics
--------

Approximately 30% of the publications will consist of graphics of icons,
buttons, entity relationships and/or flowcharts. Graphics will be
captured, created, and modified with Paint Shop Pro v7.0 and Visio
v5.0a.

Distribution & Delivery
-----------------------

Documentation will be delivered in digital format:

-  PDFs of all documentation on the product CD-ROM delivered to
   customers.

-  PDFs of all documentation available on the Customer Support website
   for download (when available).

-  HTML versions of Help files where applicable.

Internationalization & Localization
-----------------------------------

There is no current requirement for translating the documentation or
adapting it for localization.

Supplementary Material
----------------------

For this release, all product components will have basic online Help
files, which launch when a user clicks Help. In future releases, plans
include more comprehensive HTML and context-sensitive help.

Technical Writing Staff
-----------------------

Jane Smith is a Senior Technical Writer currently tasked with the
documentation for the MyCompany Jupiter.

Terminology
-----------

MyCompany Windows terminology will be maintained throughout the
documentation.

Process & Schedule
==================

Activities
----------

The following activities will be undertaken to update the documentation:

-  Creating indexes for Designer Studio User Guide and Controller User
   Guide;

-  Merging Application Notes information from previous releases into the
   Operations Guide, Designer Studio User Guide and Controller User
   Guide as required;

-  Documenting all enhancements and bug fixes for 3.2;

-  Updating and testing the XML files;

-  Updating, regenerating and testing the Help files;

-  Updating the release notes; and

-  Updating the readme files for each component.

Milestones
----------

The diversity of activities, multiple destinations of information, and
volume of material that needs to be incorporated in the manuals affect
the workload and thus the timeframe for delivery.

Note that work must be done on Callisto concurrent with some Ganymede
tasks. See Appendix 1 for a timetable of concurrent Callisto & Ganymede
activities.

Delivery of complete, updated documentation is dependant upon:

-  Availability of PD Notes for all enhancements and bug fixes for 3.2;
   and

-  Constraint of scope and code freeze early enough in the cycle to
   allow completion of files that are included in builds.

Estimated milestones, based on the current availability of the required
resources, are:

+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
| .. rubric:: Milestone                      | .. rubric:: Delivery Date   |
|    :name: milestone                        |    :name: delivery-date     |
+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
| Code Freeze (no more changes to product)   |     November 26, 2001       |
+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+
| Updated files to reviewers:                |     December 10, 2001       |
+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+

| Release (GA):                              |     January 7, 2002         |
+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+

Reviews & Approvals
-------------------

The review & approval process for updated documentation is described
below:

1. Subject-matter experts and designated reviewers review new material
       that has been added to the publications, and any changed
       material, and provide feedback;

2. Writer completes revisions.

3. Writer sends revised (final) version to approvers for signoff.
       Usually, these approvers are Customer Support Manager, Product
       Marketing Manager, Professional Services Manager, and Development
       Manager.

In general, reviews are informal and are handled via e-mail with
comments placed on the PDF versions of the documents. Reviewers may also
mark up printed copies of the documents and return to the writer for
revisions.

Change Control
--------------

Change control for documentation is handled in the same way as changes
to code:

-  During documentation development, changes and error corrections are
       communicated directly to the writer(s) via documentation
       bug/enhancement request form in Outlook, via e-mail, voice, or
       marked up copy. Changes are incorporated in the revisions.

-  After content freeze, changes or corrections are communicated in the
       same way as above, but the writer is responsible for prioritizing
       the requested fixes to determine which ones can/should be made in
       the remaining time before release. A bug review may be held to
       achieve consensus on what needs to be fixed in the documentation.

-  After release, changes or corrections to the documentation will be
       indicated in Heat. First Line Support will notify Documentation
       of the publication problems. Documentation will investigate the
       problem, and provide a solution. Depending upon the severity of
       the error or change, users will be sent a correction, or the
       change will be incorporated into the next release.

-  Major documentation changes are treated the same as bug releases and
       will be handled in conjunction with the next applicable major
       release. New documentation requests from Marketing are sent to
       the Global Customer Support Manager and then assigned to the
       appropriate Writer.

Risks
=====

The following risks are identified as having potential to affect the
delivery schedule:

-  **Dependence on current resources.** To reduce the risk, writer will
       forecast needs for developers’ time as far in advance as
       possible.

-  **Identification of scope.** Due to the volume of fixes and
       enhancements to the product since version 3.0.1, the writer may
       be hard-pressed to complete all updates to all publications/files
       within the available time frame (3 months). As long as scope has
       been correctly identified, the writer can allocate time
       appropriately to all of the update activities.

-  **Change of scope in the Development deliverables.** If scope
       changes, the depth of coverage of the documentation may have to
       be amended, or the target date extended.

-  **Implications of Mercury (3.1) release.** At the time of writing
       this documentation plan, the scope of the 3.1 release is not
       completely known. While there are a set number of approved
       enhancements listed in the Business Requirements Analysis, and
       there are HEAT numbers that have been assigned to PD for fixing,
       the total count is not yet final.

-  **Shifting priorities**.

-  **Timeliness of reviews**. Delay in turnaround of reviews may prevent
       on-time delivery. To reduce this risk, reviewers will have as
       much advance notice as possible of the requirement for a review.

Issues
======

None identified at the current time.
